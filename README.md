# Smart City Threat Model

This repository contains the Threat Model file that can be used to model threats on Smart City Infrastructure (SCI). The threat model is technology-agnostic - the SCI modeled here focuses on gathering quality of life data indicators as specified in **ISO37101:2016**, **ISO37120:2018**, **ISO37122:2019** and **ISO37123:2019** instead. 

To open the file, you will need to download the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool over [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool-releases). For more details on the intentions and contributions of this Threat Model, please refer to the arXiv paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14692).
